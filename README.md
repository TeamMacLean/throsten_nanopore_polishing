## Introduction

We are attempting to polish  nanopore data assembly using minimap2, racon and pilon with nanopore long reads and illumina short reads (in one sample using 454 reads). We will do three rounds of minimap2 and racon step as it is suggested that the assembly polishing improves while repeating the minimap2 and racon step. Finally, the nanopore polished assembly with minimap2 and racon is again polished using nextgen short reads using pilcon.
